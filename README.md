# Javascript-Projects

This repo contains almost all javascript projects I have ever done, except for my Bachelors Project since there is still work in progress. But it will be
uploaded the coming few days.


In InteractiveSystem, the seventh exercise in the .hmtl all projects from this folder are linked.


In SoftwareProject you can find the part that I contributed to it. Though it doesn't really work anymore since the database has been actived, everything is still 
accessible, by clicking on the corresponding files.
