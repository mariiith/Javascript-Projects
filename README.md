# Javascript-Projects

This repo contains almost all javascript projects I have ever done.
In InteractiveSystem, the seventh exercise in the .hmtl all projects from this folder are linked.


In SoftwareProject you can find the part that I contributed to it. Though it doesn't really work anymore since the database has been actived, everything is still 
accessible, by clicking on the corresponding files.
